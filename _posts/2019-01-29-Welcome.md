Welcome to my website! Trite introduction and stale attempt at a hook to keep coming back to this website. With that out of the way a little about me, I'm a data enthusiast hoping to make a career out of it. I plan to use this site to share small projects, explore new methods, share knowledge, and occasionally share ramblings/musings.

This site and most of the content I'll share here is self-taught, so some of it might be a little rough around the edges. With that in mind I think this platform will be a good way to practice and refine these skills even further. So if you have any advice, tips, or any feedback let me know.
