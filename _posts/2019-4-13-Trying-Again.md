There's this song I like to think about whenever I have to start over. It begins with the lyrics, "When there's nothing left to burn you have to set yourself on fire". I feel like its super applicable here. Back in January I got the idea to create my own website and create a place or portfolio type thing where I could show off neat little data science projects that I work on or just share cool content. 

To make a long story short, I spent a few weeks on and off trying to get it to work and look nice with little luck. With all that frustration and little free time as a graduate student I had to step away from the project and not fall behind on my real work. However now hopefully, I think I've figured some things out a little bit more and hope to keep learning and building this website.
